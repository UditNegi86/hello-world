# hello-world
This is a just an exploration repository
Hi Friends,
This is Udit Negi and I am jus exploring GitHub to use this in our structure.
We would have to very soon purchase a private repository and then lace our code into GitHub
I will start with moving our code into a public repository first just to try and play around.
